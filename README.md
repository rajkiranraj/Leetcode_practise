Build strong DSA foundations 📚
Solve problems daily & consistently ⏳
Track growth through this repo 🌱
📅 Daily Progress
Day	Problem	Language	Status	Notes
✅ Day 1	Kadane’s Algorithm	C++	✔ Solved	Learned why reset happens after updating max
✅ Day 2	Second Largest Element	C++	✔ Solved	Practiced single pass vs sorting
⏳ Day 3	—	—	🔜	—
🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: C++ (main), Java (secondary)
Focus: DSA, Algorithms, Problem Solving
Tools: GitHub, LeetCode, Codeforces, GFG
📝 Notes & Learnings
📖 Each day I’ll add:
Problem statement
Code implementation
Dry run (if needed)
Complexity analysis
🔥 Motivation
"Consistency beats intensity. Small progress each day leads to big results."
